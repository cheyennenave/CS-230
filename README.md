Operating Platforms
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
---The Gaming Room client is a company that has created a game "Draw It or Lose It". They have hired me and my team to help build the environment and streamline development for their game. The game itself must have teams with players assigned to it, unique naming conventions for both players and teams, and only one instance of the game may exist at a time. The app will render an image from a library stock and the team must guess within 30 seconds what the image is. If they fail, the opposing team has 15 seconds to guess.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
---I was clear in my guidance on the Software Design document. I completed thorough research according to each topic given and gave a good list of pros and cons on various operating systems.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
---I really enjoyed how the design document acted like a road map to developing code. It laid out what is suggested, what could be improved, and what to avoid on both user-end and client-end.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
---I would be more thorough in my Evaluation. While I did provide pros and cons for each operating system, I'd like to add updates per version of the design document without changing what the previous version had. This way, I could see the streamline of thought and understand a little better why the recommendations are what they are.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
---I paid attention to the details of their needs. Time, Budget, and many other factors played big parts when it came to development. It is highly important to pay attention to the user's needs because these same factors may change development time or their budget may flux due to hurdles the development team faces. These are hard facts that the user must know in order to move forward.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
---I took the basic requirements of the Gaming Room and "mapped" them on a UML diagram. This included all aspects of the game such as one instance of the game existing or teams being made of players. Once I had the UML diagram finished, I looked at what would be needed make these pieces work together, like cogs (essentially Structured Design). In the future, I'll continue to use UML diagrams because they really help visualize the end product and what it needs to do. I'll also broaden my horizons to Function-Oriented Design as well to make sure that my applications are well rounded.
